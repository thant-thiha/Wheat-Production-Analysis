# Wheat Production Analysis

**Goal:** Analyze and optimize wheat production and supply chain efficiency using data-driven methods.

## Overview
- Covers 900 records from global wheat production fields (Brazil, India, Australia, US, Canada, Syria).
- Follows the PACE framework: Plan, Analyze, Construct, Execute for structured analytics and recommendations.

## Approach
- **Data Cleaning/EDA:** Validated and cleaned production, weather, soil, cost, and yield data.
- **Feature Engineering:** Created metrics such as fertilizer efficiency, ROI, profit per hectare.
- **Statistical Analysis:** Explored regional, soil, and weather impacts on yield and profit.
- **Modeling:** Compared PCA, LDA for dimensionality reduction, and built classification/regression models (Random Forest, XGBoost, Logistic Regression).
- **Evaluation:** Assessed model performance, feature importance, and provided improvement strategies.

## Key Insights
- **Top yield/profit:** North America, Asia, Africa highest ROI and net yield; price, fertilizer, pest, and cost key predictors.
- **Low model accuracy:** Predicting yield category is complex; current features need improvement for stronger prediction.
- **Practical recommendations:** Enhance features, expand sample diversity, tune hyperparameters, and target process improvements for robust, data-backed decisions.

## Recommendations
- Apply advanced feature selection and engineering.
- Incorporate more data from diverse regions/seasons.
- Use Random Forest/XGBoost for robust predictions.
- Align ongoing optimization to data-driven insights.
